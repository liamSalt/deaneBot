underground:**Alfie's**
Alfie's, a student-run bar, opened its doors in the 1970s [the Encyclopedia previously noted both 1971 and 1976 as the opening date] as "The Underground," a reference to its location in the basement of the John Deutsch University Centre (JDUC). It was renamed Alfie's in 1979 in honour of Alfie Pierce, a long-time cheerleader for the Queen's football team.
