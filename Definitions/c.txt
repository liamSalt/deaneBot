clocktower:**Grant Hall**
With its tall limestone clock-tower, this assembly and concert hall, completed in 1905, is Queen's best-known landmark. Fittingly, it is named after Queen's most important principal, George Monro Grant, a national figure in his own right who gave Queen's, for the first time, a national mission and profile.
